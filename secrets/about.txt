Put your accounts' secrets here. Each account should have its own file, named <accountname>.json.

For example, if I have an account named "foobar", then I should create a file named "foobar.json".

Each json file should contain the raw response object that you received from Steam when you enabled two-factor
authentication.

These files are read on-the-fly when needed, so there is no need to restart the server with you add/remove/change one.
